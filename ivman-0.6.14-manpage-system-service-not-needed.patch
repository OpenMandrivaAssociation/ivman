 Ivman is a flexible device manager, allowing users to run arbitrary commands when devices
 are added/removed, when device properties change, and when devices emit conditions.
 
-For automount purposes, Ivman should be run once from a system-wide init script and once
-per user session (e.g., create a link to /usr/bin/ivman in  ~/.kde/Autostart or
-put an entry for /usr/bin/ivman in gnome-session-manager).
-When a device is attached, Ivman will call pmount or mount to mount the device.  If pmount is used, it will mount

 Ivman is supplied with sensible default configuration files for
 volume management, but autoplay functionality has no default actions;
